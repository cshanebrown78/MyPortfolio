                    <p class="mb-4">Hello, my name is Christopher Shane Brown.  I know you are wondering if I go by Christopher or Chris, but I actually go by Shane.  In 1996 I graduated from Athens High School and started studying at the University of Texas where I graduated with a bachelors degree in Economics and a  business foundations certificate.
                   After spending more than 10 years as a Financial Analyst and being laid off twice in 3 years I decided to make a change.  Having always liked programming and computers in school, I decided that coding boot camp was a good path for me and started a program to become a full stack web developer.  This was something that I could use as a career and could be combined with my Analyst experience</p>

            <!-- <p>Hello, my name is Christopher Shane Brown.  I know you are wondering if I go by Christopher or Chris, but I actually go by Shane.  My parents didn't think that Shane Christopher Brown flowed well, but always intended on calling me Shane.  I was born in Texas, but my family lived in East New Mexico at the time.  The best and closest hospital, however, was in Levelland Texas.  I have lived in different parts of Texas and New Mexico.  In 1996 I graduated from Athens High School and started studying at the University of Texas where I graduated with a bachelors degree in Economics with a business foundations minor.</p>
            <p>It took me a while and several different jobs, but I finally broke into finance in 2009.  I spent the next 10 years as a financial analyst.  Now you may be wondering why I would leave such and illustrious and exciting career.  Well, the answer is two layoffs in three years and not a lot of options.  On top of that, I didn't really like what I was doing, so it was time for a career change.  I did always like programming and computers in school, so I started looking at different IT certification programs, but did not feel like any of them suited me.  The more I looked into different options the more I felt drawn to full stack web development.  It involves programming and computers and is in high demand and should be for the foreseeable future.</p>
